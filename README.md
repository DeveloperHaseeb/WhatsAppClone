# WhatsAppClone
It is very first version of my WhatsApp Clone and It is not very efficient in usage. It just
lets you use different functions of WhatsApp on a command line (terminal). 

It is my first python code so please bear with me.
Sorry for no comments in this code.
I have not uploaded the completed latest version.
